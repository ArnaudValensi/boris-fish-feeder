## Description

Boris-fish-feeder is a simple fish feeder 3d printed and working with an arduino.
Boris (my goldfish) likes to eat a little bit, but all day long. Also, he never
wants to go in vacation with me. I had to find a way to automatically feed him.

The feeder works with a servo motor Futaba S3003 modified to have continuous
rotation. You can find how to do it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK8mhnEzcvY

All the parts can be assembled with M3 screws.
